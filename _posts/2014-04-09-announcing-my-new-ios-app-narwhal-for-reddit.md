I am pleased to announce the launch of my latest iOS application, [narwhal for reddit](http://getnarwhal.com), that I made with my friend [Ken Finney](http://twitter.com/kenfinney). Narwhal is a client for reddit.com focused on simplicity and design. The feature set we chose to incorporate revolves around the core browsing and interaction experience of reddit. Actions such as reading links and comments, voting, posting comments, and reading your messages.

It's free so go ahead and [download already!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id845422455?mt=8)
